| [Gatekeeper](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gatekeeper) | Protect applications and services by using a dedicated host instance that acts as a broker between clients and the application or service, validates and sanitizes requests, and passes requests and data between them.
| [Gateway Aggregation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/gateway-aggregation) | Use a gateway to aggregate multiple individual requests into a single request.

| [Health Endpoint Monitoring](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/health-endpoint-monitoring) | Implement functional checks in an application that external tools can access through exposed endpoints at regular intervals.
| [Index Table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/index-table) | Create indexes over the fields in data stores that are frequently referenced by queries.
| [Leader Election](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/leader-election) | Coordinate the actions performed by a collection of collaborating task instances in a distributed application by electing one instance as the leader that assumes responsibility for managing the other instances.
| [Materialized View](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/materialized-view) | Generate prepopulated views over the data in one or more data stores when the data isn't ideally formatted for required query operations.
| [Pipes and Filters](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/pipes-and-filters) | Break down a task that performs complex processing into a series of separate elements that can be reused.
| [Priority Queue](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/priority-queue) | Prioritize requests sent to services so that requests with a higher priority are received and processed more quickly than those with a lower priority.
| [Publisher/Subscriber](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/publisher-subscriber) | Enable an application to announce events to multiple interested consumers asynchronously, without coupling the senders to the receivers.
| [Queue-Based Load Leveling](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/queue-based-load-leveling) | Use a queue that acts as a buffer between a task and a service that it invokes in order to smooth intermittent heavy loads.
| [Retry](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/retry) | Enable an application to handle anticipated, temporary failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource by transparently retrying an operation that's previously failed.
